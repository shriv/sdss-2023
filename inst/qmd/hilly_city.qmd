New Zealand sits on the Pacific "Ring of Fire". The whole country has been shaped over time through various seismic activities - including the present-day geography of Wellington. @fig-te-ara shows land uplift along the shorelines creating extensive flat area in the city. This uplifted land is critical to the city's CBD, potential high density development and the airport.

## All streets
A gradient map of the city streets is dominated by orange and red. The summary table indicates that only 43% of the street network (by length) in the city is flat or mild gradients - the most comfortable for walkers for all abilities.

Compared to Wellington, the streets of Lisbon and Leeds are predominantly flat. Zurich has extensive hilly streets in the outskirts but the expanse of green appears considerably larger than Wellington.

## Residential
@fig-hilly-suburbs shows the topographical division of urban form with tall buildings in the flat city centre and residential housing spreading all over the nearby hills. If we only consider residential areas, the topographical profile of the city slips with 67% of streets of at least medium gradient.
