In Wellington, hills increase walking time to playgrounds by 9\% on average. This post further shows how walkability can be analysed from two perspectives: (1) accessibility \_from\_ homes \_to\_ playgrounds or, (2) catchment areas of playgrounds. Depending on the goal of the analysis, the same underlying dataset can be used to produce either perspective.},
