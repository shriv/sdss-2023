# Preface {#sec-preface}
Walkability is a subset of quantitative accessibility analyses (which tend to be multi-modal). Walkability is also a qualitative framework of theoretical concepts that underpin people's preference for walking. A useful framework that considers multiple facets of walking is **the 5C's of walkability** @londonplanningadvisorycommitteePuttingLondonBack1997: 

- Convenient
- Convivial
- Connected
- Comfortable
- Conspicuous

Convenient and connected include various aspects of the built environment across urban form and transport infrastructure including provision of walking paths, density of amenities, convenience of routes (direct rather than roundabout) etc. Spatial data science is especially relevant here e.g. point pattern analysis (of amenities) and spatial network analysis to better understand the structure of connectivity and potential routes. 

Convenience is also influenced by the natural topography. While most cities of the world have come up and spread along areas of flat and mild gradients, inclined streets exist due to nearby hills and mountains. Pronounced examples of predominantly hilly cities include SÃ£o Paolo, Brazil and Wellington, New Zealand. Unfortunately, walkability analyses typically ignore the impact of street inclines since the majority of large cities are predominantly flat. 

@sec-hilly-city describes the topographical challenge for Wellington walkers - especially those in suburbs. @sec-network-analysis outlines how network routing can be tuned to better represent real world walking times. @sec-walkability uses network routing to analyse a simple case of local walkability questioning whether the walk _to_ the park is as easy as a walk _in_ the park? @sec-preference compares potential for walking to actual walking.
